# Chapter 09: Blog - Complete CMS

Full content management system with authentication, blog, pages, categories, and documentation.

## Learning Objectives

- Build complete authentication system (login, logout, register)
- Implement blog with posts, categories, and tags
- Create static pages with markdown support
- Design category management with post associations
- Generate documentation from filesystem markdown

## Directory Structure

```
09-Blog/
├── public/
│   ├── index.php
│   └── data/           # SQLite databases
└── src/
    ├── Core/           # Init, Ctx, Db, Plugin, Theme, Util
    ├── Plugins/        # Auth/, Blog/, Posts/, Pages/, Categories/, Users/, Docs/
    └── Themes/
```

## Plugins

Auth: Login, logout, registration, password reset
Blog: Public blog view with excerpts and pagination
Posts: Admin CRUD for blog posts
Pages: Static page management
Categories: Category CRUD with post associations
Users: User management (from Chapter 08)
Docs: Filesystem-based documentation viewer

## Features

Markdown Support: Posts and pages support markdown content
Featured Images: Posts can have featured images
Excerpts: Auto-generated or custom excerpts
Category Tags: Posts associated with multiple categories
Post Types: post, page, doc (polymorphic posts table)

## Database Schema

posts: id, user_id, title, slug, content, excerpt, type, status, featured_image, created_at
categories: id, name, slug, description
post_categories: post_id, category_id (junction table)
users: id, email, password, name, role, created_at

## Running

```
cd 09-Blog/public
php -S localhost:8080
```

## AI Guidelines

- This is the "production-ready" chapter
- Complete auth flow with session management
- Posts table uses 'type' field for polymorphism (post/page/doc)
- Markdown rendered via Util::md() method
- Most complex chapter; includes all previous patterns
- Namespace: SPE\Blog\
