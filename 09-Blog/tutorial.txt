7|http://localhost:8080/09-Blog|Welcome to Chapter Nine, the final chapter. We're building a complete blog CMS with authentication, posts, categories, and markdown support.

# --- Live Demo ---
6|http://localhost:8080/09-Blog?o=Blog|Here's the public blog view. Posts are displayed as cards with featured images, titles, excerpts, and author information.
5|http://localhost:8080/09-Blog?o=Blog&m=read&i=1|Clicking a post shows the full article. Markdown content is rendered to HTML. Categories and navigation links appear below.
5|http://localhost:8080/09-Blog?o=Auth|The login page handles authentication. Admin users can manage posts, categories, pages, and user accounts.
5|http://localhost:8080/09-Blog?o=Posts|The Posts admin shows all blog entries. Authors can create, edit, and delete their own posts. Admins can manage everything.
