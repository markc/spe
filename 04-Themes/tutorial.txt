6|http://localhost:8080/04-Themes/public/index.php|Same pages, deeper separation. Chapter Four splits data from presentation with switchable layouts.

# --- Introduction ---
7|http://localhost:8080/04-Themes/public/index.php|The application looks familiar. But the code now has three layers: Models return data, Views render H T M L, Themes wrap layouts.

# --- Live Demo: Themes ---
5|http://localhost:8080/04-Themes/public/index.php|Simple theme. Centered container with card navigation, just like Chapter Three.
5|http://localhost:8080/04-Themes/public/index.php?t=TopNav|TopNav theme. Fixed navigation bar at the top. Same content, completely different layout.
5|http://localhost:8080/04-Themes/public/index.php?t=SideBar|SideBar theme. Two-column layout with grouped navigation on the left.
5|http://localhost:8080/04-Themes/public/index.php?o=Contact&t=SideBar|Contact page in SideBar. The theme persists as you navigate between pages.

# --- Live Demo: Dropdown ---
6|http://localhost:8080/04-Themes/public/index.php|The themes dropdown uses pure C S S. Hover to reveal, click to switch. No JavaScript required.

# --- Context Class ---
7|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/04-Themes/public/index.php#L4-L17|The Ctx class adds a themes array alongside navigation. Both define menu structures in one place.
6|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/04-Themes/public/index.php#L8|The in array includes t for theme selection. Default is Simple.

# --- Init Dispatch Chain ---
7|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/04-Themes/public/index.php#L23-L29|Init orchestrates Model, View, and Theme. Model runs first, returning a data array.
6|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/04-Themes/public/index.php#L27-L28|View receives the model data and renders H T M L. If no View exists, the model data is wrapped in a paragraph.
6|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/04-Themes/public/index.php#L32-L36|The to string method invokes the selected theme. Dynamic method call based on the t parameter.

# --- Models Return Data ---
7|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/04-Themes/public/index.php#L49-L52|Models return arrays, not strings. Head for title, main for content. No H T M L, just semantic data.

# --- Views Render Fragments ---
7|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/04-Themes/public/index.php#L67-L77|The base View wraps model data in a card. Specific views like ContactView add forms and interactivity.

# --- Theme Class ---
7|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/04-Themes/public/index.php#L120-L131|The Theme class has a nav helper using the pipe operator. Links preserve the current theme in the U R L.
6|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/04-Themes/public/index.php#L133-L142|The dropdown method builds the themes menu. C S S handles visibility on hover.

# --- Theme Layouts ---
6|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/04-Themes/public/index.php#L162-L177|Simple layout. Container, card nav with dropdown, main content, footer.
6|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/04-Themes/public/index.php#L179-L193|TopNav layout. Fixed navigation bar with brand, links, dropdown, and toggle buttons.
6|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/04-Themes/public/index.php#L195-L233|SideBar layout. Topnav plus two-column split with aside and main regions.

# --- Conclusion ---
6|http://localhost:8080/04-Themes/public/index.php|That's Chapter Four. Model View Theme separation with three switchable layouts and a C S S dropdown.
5|http://localhost:8080/04-Themes/public/index.php|Next chapter introduces P S R 4 autoloading to organize classes into separate files.
