# --- Introduction ---
7|http://localhost:8080/04-Themes/public/index.php|Welcome to Chapter Four. We're adding Model View separation and a powerful theming system with multiple layouts.

# --- Live Demo ---
6|http://localhost:8080/04-Themes/public/index.php|The application now supports multiple themes. We start with the Simple theme, similar to previous chapters.
5|http://localhost:8080/04-Themes/public/index.php?t=TopNav|Switching to TopNav moves navigation to a horizontal bar at the top. Same content, different layout.
6|http://localhost:8080/04-Themes/public/index.php?t=SideBar|The SideBar theme places navigation vertically on the left. Themes can completely transform the interface.
5|http://localhost:8080/04-Themes/public/index.php?o=About&t=SideBar|Pages work with any theme. Here's About with the SideBar layout. Let's examine the code.

# --- Code: Context Class ---
8|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/04-Themes/public/index.php#L5-L19|The Context class now has two navigation arrays. Nav 1 for page links, nav 2 for theme options.
7|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/04-Themes/public/index.php#L10|The in array adds a t parameter for theme selection. Users can switch between different layout styles.
7|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/04-Themes/public/index.php#L16-L17|Nav 1 contains page links with emoji labels. Nav 2 contains theme options: Simple, TopNav, and SideBar.

# --- Code: Init Class ---
8|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/04-Themes/public/index.php#L21-L49|Init handles both Model and View routing. It first loads the Model for data, then renders with the Theme.
7|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/04-Themes/public/index.php#L28-L29|The model name is built from the o parameter. If a Model class exists, it's instantiated and called.
8|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/04-Themes/public/index.php#L36-L40|View resolution tries the specific View first, then falls back to the Theme. This enables per-page customization.

# --- Code: Theme Classes ---
7|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/04-Themes/public/index.php#L51-L70|The base Theme class provides shared navigation building. Child themes override the render method.
6|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/04-Themes/public/index.php#L72-L90|Simple theme wraps content in a centered container. TopNav adds a fixed header bar.
7|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/04-Themes/public/index.php#L92-L115|SideBar theme creates a two-column layout. Navigation in the left column, content on the right.

# --- Conclusion ---
6|http://localhost:8080/04-Themes/public/index.php|That's Chapter Four. Model View separation and swappable themes that transform the entire layout.
4|http://localhost:8080/04-Themes/public/index.php|Next chapter introduces Composer autoloading for proper namespace organization!
