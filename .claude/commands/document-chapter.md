Document SPE chapter $ARGUMENTS using the prose-style documentation approach.

## Instructions

1. Read these files for the chapter:
   - `$ARGUMENTS/public/index.php` (or `$ARGUMENTS/src/` for later chapters)
   - `$ARGUMENTS/tutorial.txt` (for narrative guidance)
   - `docs/$ARGUMENTS/README.md` (current state)

2. Completely refactor `docs/$ARGUMENTS/README.md` to extensively describe how the chapter actually works rather than using headline features.

3. Follow these guidelines:
   - Use longer paragraphs rather than bullet points for conceptual content
   - Analyze every line, property, and method
   - Describe each step and especially WHY this code structure is used
   - Connect patterns to specific PHP version features
   - Show data flow through the application
   - Foreshadow how patterns evolve in later chapters

4. Reference the style guide at `.claude/runbooks/documentation-style-guide.md` for detailed formatting rules.

5. The output should read like a technical essay that teaches through explanation, not a feature list.
