# Format: duration|URL|text
# Pronunciation: Use spaces for acronyms (P H P)

# --- Hook ---
6|http://localhost:8080/02-Styled/public/index.php|Two lines of code. External C S S and JavaScript. Plain H T M L transforms into a polished, themed interface.

# --- Introduction ---
7|http://localhost:8080/02-Styled/public/index.php|Chapter Two introduces the external asset layer. The P H P structure stays identical to Chapter One, but the output transforms completely.

# --- Live Demo ---
5|http://localhost:8080/02-Styled/public/index.php|The home page now has card layouts, proper typography, and visual hierarchy.
5|http://localhost:8080/02-Styled/public/index.php?m=about|About page. Notice the active state in navigation. The current link is highlighted.
5|http://localhost:8080/02-Styled/public/index.php?m=contact|Contact page includes a form. The styling comes entirely from external C S S.
6|http://localhost:8080/02-Styled/public/index.php|Click the moon icon. Dark mode activates instantly. The preference saves to local storage.|click:#theme-icon
5|http://localhost:8080/02-Styled/public/index.php|Toast notifications provide user feedback. Success and danger variants.|click:.btn-success

# --- Data Structure ---
7|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/02-Styled/public/index.php#L6-L10|The pages array evolves to three elements. Emoji plus label for navigation, title for the heading, content for the body.

# --- External Assets ---
6|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/02-Styled/public/index.php#L43|The stylesheet link loads spe dot C S S. Three hundred lines of utility classes, components, and theme variables.
5|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/02-Styled/public/index.php#L61|The script tag loads spe dot J S. Theme management, toast notifications, and interactive behaviors.

# --- Navigation Active State ---
7|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/02-Styled/public/index.php#L25-L31|Navigation generation adds conditional active classes. The sprintf formats each link with a class when the route matches.

# --- Theme Toggle ---
6|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/02-Styled/public/index.php#L48|The theme toggle button sits in the nav. JavaScript handles the click, swapping light and dark classes on the document.

# --- Contact Form ---
7|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/02-Styled/public/index.php#L67-L83|The private contact form method returns H T M L. JavaScript intercepts submission and opens the user's email client with prefilled values.

# --- CSS Architecture ---
7|http://localhost:8080/02-Styled/public/index.php|The C S S uses custom properties for theming. Colors like bg, fg, and accent define the palette. Dark mode overrides these same variables.|click:#theme-icon

# --- Conclusion ---
6|http://localhost:8080/02-Styled/public/index.php|That's Chapter Two. External assets, dark mode theming, toast notifications, and form handling. All with the same self-rendering pattern.
5|http://localhost:8080/02-Styled/public/index.php|Next chapter introduces the plugin architecture for extensible applications.
