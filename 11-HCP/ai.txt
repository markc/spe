# Chapter 11: HCP - Hosting Control Panel

Lightweight hosting control panel for managing Nginx vhosts, DNS zones, and SSL certificates.

## Learning Objectives

- Build server administration interfaces
- Manage Nginx virtual host configurations
- Handle DNS zone file generation
- Integrate Let's Encrypt SSL certificates
- Execute system commands safely from PHP

## Directory Structure

```
11-HCP/
├── bin/                # CLI management scripts
├── data/               # SQLite database, generated configs
├── docs/               # Documentation
├── etc/                # Configuration templates
├── lib/                # Shared library classes
├── public/index.php
├── schema/             # Database schema files
├── src/
│   ├── Core/
│   └── Plugins/        # Vhosts/, DNS/, SSL/, System/
└── vendor/
```

## Plugins

Vhosts: Nginx virtual host management
DNS: Zone file generation and management
SSL: Let's Encrypt certificate management
System: Server status, logs, processes

## Features

Vhost Templates: Generate Nginx configs from templates
DNS Zones: Create and manage DNS zone files
SSL Automation: Request and renew Let's Encrypt certificates
System Commands: Safe execution of whitelisted commands

## Security Considerations

- Runs with elevated privileges (manages system configs)
- Designed for Proxmox VM/container environments
- Not for shared hosting (single-tenant only)
- Whitelist approach for system commands

## Running

```
cd 11-HCP
composer install
cp .env.example .env  # Configure environment
php -S localhost:8080 -t public
```

## AI Guidelines

- This is an INFRASTRUCTURE chapter, not typical web app
- Requires root/sudo access for config file management
- Designed for Proxmox VMs/CTs (Linux only)
- Uses bin/ scripts for actual system operations
- PHP interface is control plane; bin scripts are data plane
- Namespace: SPE\HCP\
