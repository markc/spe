# --- Project Introduction ---
7|https://github.com/markc/spe|Welcome to Simple PHP Examples. A progressive PHP 8.5 micro-framework tutorial in 10 chapters. Each chapter builds on the previous, demonstrating modern PHP features.
6|https://github.com/markc/spe|This project is completely open source under the MIT license. You can clone it, run it locally, modify it, and learn by doing.
7|https://github.com/markc/spe|PHP 8.5 introduces the pipe operator for elegant data transformation. We use it throughout, along with typed constants, asymmetric visibility, and enums.

# --- GitHub Repository Tour ---
6|https://github.com/markc/spe#chapters|The project has 10 chapters. Starting with a 32-line single-file app, we progressively add CSS styling, plugins, themes, autoloading, sessions, and database access.
7|https://github.com/markc/spe/tree/main/01-Simple|Chapter One is Simple. A complete web application in one anonymous class. It demonstrates the pipe operator and PHP 8.4 asymmetric visibility.
6|https://github.com/markc/spe/tree/main/09-Blog|Chapter Nine is Blog. A full content management system with authentication, posts, pages, categories, and markdown support. Production ready.
6|https://github.com/markc/spe/tree/main/00-Tutorial|Chapter Zero is where you are now. This folder contains the tooling used to create these very tutorial videos. Yes, it's recursive!

# --- Running Locally ---
7|https://github.com/markc/spe#quick-start|To run locally, clone the repo, install Composer dependencies, and start PHP's built-in server. That's it. No Docker, no complex setup.
6|http://localhost:8080/01-Simple|Each chapter runs independently. Navigate to any chapter directory and see it in action. The interface is clean and responsive with custom CSS.
5|http://localhost:8080/01-Simple?m=about|URL parameters control navigation. The m parameter selects which page to display. Simple routing without a framework.

# --- YouTube Tutorial Series ---
7|https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM0Did14jsitwKl7RYaVrUWnG1GkRBO4B|Every chapter has a companion video tutorial on YouTube. Watch the explanations, then experiment with the code yourself.
6|https://github.com/markc/spe|The videos walk through each chapter's source code, explain the PHP features used, and demonstrate the running application.

# --- How These Tutorials Are Made ---
8|https://github.com/markc/spe/tree/main/00-Tutorial|Now for the fun part. How are these tutorial videos created? The answer is in chapter zero. A complete video generation pipeline.
7|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/00-Tutorial/scripts/spe-tutorial.sh|The main script is spe-tutorial.sh. It orchestrates audio generation, screenshot capture, and video assembly. One command creates a complete tutorial.
7|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/01-Simple/tutorial.txt|Each chapter has a tutorial.txt file. This simple format specifies duration, URL, and narration text. Edit the script, regenerate the video.
8|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/00-Tutorial/scripts/capture.ts|Playwright automates screenshot capture. It reads the URLs from tutorial.txt, loads each page, and saves 4K screenshots. GitHub and localhost are both supported.

# --- The Video Pipeline ---
7|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/00-Tutorial/README.md#workflow|The workflow has four steps. First, edit the narration script. Second, generate AI voiceover with Piper TTS. Third, capture screenshots. Fourth, assemble the final video.
6|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/00-Tutorial/README.md|Piper TTS generates natural-sounding narration from text. The hfc male voice provides clear, professional audio for technical content.
7|https://github.com/markc/spe/blob/main/00-Tutorial/README.md#commands-reference|The melt command combines video and audio with smooth crossfades. Hardware acceleration with Intel VAAPI keeps rendering fast.
