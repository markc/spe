# Chapter 00: Tutorial Video Generation

Video generation pipeline for creating 4K screencast tutorials with AI voiceover.

## Purpose

This chapter provides the tooling infrastructure for generating tutorial videos, not PHP code. It's Chapter 00 because it's prerequisite tooling, not part of the progressive PHP tutorial.

## Technology Stack

- Bun runtime with TypeScript
- Playwright for automated browser capture
- Piper TTS for AI voiceover
- FFmpeg/MLT for video assembly
- KDE Plasma Wayland on CachyOS/Arch Linux

## Key Files

scripts/spe-tutorial.sh: Main pipeline orchestrator (audio, slides, assembly, render)
scripts/capture.ts: Playwright screenshot automation from tutorial.txt URLs
scripts/demo.ts: Interactive demo capture for forms and CRUD operations
package.json: Bun dependencies (Playwright)

## Workflow

1. Edit tutorial.txt in chapter directory (format: duration|URL|narration)
2. Generate audio: ./scripts/spe-tutorial.sh 01-Simple audio
3. Capture frames: bun run capture 01-Simple
4. Assemble video: ./scripts/spe-tutorial.sh 01-Simple assemble

## Output

4K UHD (3840x2160) MP4 videos at 30fps with AAC audio.

## AI Guidelines

- This is NOT a PHP chapter; it's video tooling
- Requires KDE Plasma Wayland (not wlroots compositors)
- Tutorial.txt files in each chapter are the narration scripts
- Piper TTS is local and free; produces good quality voiceover
- Videos are uploaded to YouTube playlist
