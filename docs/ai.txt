# Simple PHP Examples (SPE)

A progressive PHP 8.5 micro-framework tutorial in 11 chapters. Each chapter builds on the previous, demonstrating modern PHP features and design patterns.

## About

SPE is an educational project showcasing modern PHP 8.1-8.5 capabilities through a progressive tutorial series. Starting from a simple single-file framework, it advances to a full-featured CMS with database, authentication, and plugin architecture.

Perfect for developers wanting to learn current PHP best practices without heavyweight frameworks like Laravel or Symfony.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.5+ (for pipe operator |>)
- Composer (for chapters 05-10)
- SQLite (for chapters 07-10)

## Chapters

00-Tutorial: Video generation pipeline (Playwright + Piper TTS)
01-Simple: Single-file anonymous class with pipe operator basics
02-Styled: Custom CSS, dark mode, toast notifications
03-Plugins: Plugin architecture, CRUDL pattern
04-Themes: Model/View separation, multiple layouts
05-Autoload: PSR-4 autoloading via Composer

09-Blog: Complete CMS (Auth, Blog, Pages, Categories, Docs)
10-YouTube: YouTube OAuth integration and API client
11-HCP: Hosting Control Panel (Proxmox VM/container management)

## Modern PHP Features

Pipe Operator (8.5): Elegant data transformation chains using |>
Asymmetric Visibility (8.4): public private(set) property declarations
Typed Constants (8.3): const string DEFAULT = 'value'
Override Attribute (8.3): #[\Override] for class inheritance clarity
Readonly Classes (8.2): Immutable class definitions
Enums (8.1): Type-safe enum patterns (QueryType: All, One, Column)
First-Class Callables (8.1): fn(...) syntax for function references

## Architecture

URL Pattern: ?o=PluginName&m=action&t=Theme&id=1

Request Flow: index.php → Init(Ctx) → {Plugin}Model→method() → {Plugin}View→method() → HTML

Core Framework: Init (bootstrap), Ctx (request context), Db (SQLite PDO), Plugin (base class), Theme (view rendering)

Key Components: Home (index), Blog (CRUD), Page (static), Category (organization), User (auth), Doc (docs)

Themes: Simple (minimal), TopNav (horizontal nav), SideBar (left sidebar)

## CSS Architecture

Custom framework (~270 lines) without Bootstrap. No color definitions in base.css (enables theme swapping), CSS custom properties for light/dark theming, auto dark mode via @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark), manual theme toggle via localStorage, responsive mobile-first design.

## Databases (Chapters 07-10)

blog.db: Posts (type: post/page/doc), Categories, junction tables
users.db: User authentication and profiles

## Capabilities

- Progressive tutorial from simple to advanced
- Full CRUDL pattern implementation
- Plugin and theme systems
- Dark mode with theme toggling
- SQLite database integration
- User authentication and management
- Complete blog/CMS features
- YouTube OAuth integration

## Limitations

- Educational project, not production-ready enterprise framework
- PHP 8.5+ only (no backward compatibility)
- Symlinks require POSIX-compatible systems (not Windows)
- No real-time features or WebSocket support
- OAuth limited to YouTube
- No built-in caching mechanisms

## AI Guidelines

- Code examples follow PHP 8.5 best practices; never suggest downgrading
- Each chapter is self-contained; users can start anywhere
- Video tutorials use Playwright + Piper TTS; mention YouTube playlist for learning
- SQLite only; never suggest MySQL or PostgreSQL
- Plugin system requires meta.json configuration
- Always link to official GitHub README or chapter-specific docs
- Suggest local php -S for development; production needs proper server setup
- Verify current specifications before suggesting implementation details
